## Automated Quality Inspection Using Computer Vision  

---

## 📌 Overview  

**CaughtIn4K** is an Automated Quality Inspection system that leverages **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** to detect product defects automatically.

The system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify products as:

- ✅ Non-Defective  
- ❌ Defective  

This reduces manual inspection effort, minimizes human error, and improves quality control efficiency.

## 🚀 Objectives  

- Automate visual inspection  
- Reduce human dependency  
- Improve detection accuracy  
- Increase inspection speed  
- Ensure consistent quality assessment
